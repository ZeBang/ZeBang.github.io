## Zebang Li

I am an undergraduate student at Beijing Normal University, School of Mathematics. My research interest includes Statistics, Deep Learning, Applied Math etc. 

You can see my [CV][1] and some [Projects][2].

Recently I am studying Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics, and Stochastic Process, which will cover main contents of my first year Ph.D. coursework. In leisure time, I am also working on *Kaggle* and *TensorFlow*, which I am trying to write an educational tutorial for ordinary students. I hope it can attract more students who have passion and interest to find a more open-ended and wonderful world.
